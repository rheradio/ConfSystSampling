  abstract  = {Recent years have seen an unprecedented adoption of artificial intelligence in wide variety of applications ranging from medical diagnosis, automobile, security to aircraft collision avoidance. Probabilistic reasoning is a key component of such modern artificial intelligence systems. Sampling techniques form the core of the state of the art probabilistic reasoning systems. In contrast to testing for deterministic programs, where one trace is sufficient to prove the existence of a bug; such is not the case for samplers as one sample is typically not sufficient to prove non-conformity of the sampler to the desired distribution. This makes one wonder: whether it is possible to design testing methodology to test whether a sampler under test generates samples close to a given distribution. The primary contribution of this paper is a positive answer to the above question: We design, to the best of our knowledge, the first algorithmic framework, Barbarik, to test whether the distribution generated by $\varepsilon-$close or $\eta-$far from the uniform distribution. In contrast to the sampling techniques that require an exponential or sub-exponential number of samples for sampler whose support can be represented by $n$ bits, Barbarik requires only $\mathcal{O}(1/(\eta-\varepsilon)^2)$ samples. We present a prototype implementation of Barbarik and use it to test three state of the art uniform samplers over the support defined by combinatorial constraints. Barbarik is able to provide a certificate of uniformity to one sampler and demonstrate non-uniformity for the other two samplers.},

Sci.43, 169–188), which either require a ΣP2 oracle or obtain only almost uniform generation. Our procedure utilizes ideas originating in the works of M. Sipser, and L.

  abstract = {Modeling the performance of a highly configurable software system requires capturing the influences of its configuration options and their interactions on the system's performance. Performance-influence models quantify these influences, explaining this way the performance behavior of a configurable system as a whole. To be useful in practice, a performance-influence model should have a low prediction error, small model size, and reasonable computation time. Because of the inherent tradeoffs among these properties, optimizing for one property may negatively influence the others. It is unclear, though, to what extent these tradeoffs manifest themselves in practice, that is, whether a large configuration space can be described accurately only with large models and significant resource investment. By means of 10 real-world highly configurable systems from different domains, we have systematically studied the tradeoffs between the three properties. Surprisingly, we found that the tradeoffs between prediction error and model size and between prediction error and computation time are rather marginal. That is, we can learn accurate and small models in reasonable time, so that one performance-influence model can fit different use cases, such as program comprehension and performance prediction. We further investigated the reasons for why the tradeoffs are marginal. We found that interactions among four or more configuration options have only a minor influence on the prediction error and that ignoring them when learning a performance-influence model can save a substantial amount of computation time, while keeping the model small without considerably increasing the prediction error. This is an important insight for new sampling and learning techniques as they can focus on specific regions of the configuration space and find a sweet spot between accuracy and effort. We further analyzed the causes for the configuration options and their interactions having the observed influences on the systems' performance. We were able to identify several patterns across subject systems, such as dominant configuration options and data pipelines, that explain the influences of highly influential configuration options and interactions, and give further insights into the domain of highly configurable systems.},

  abstract = {Decision models are widely used in software engineering to describe and restrict decision-making (e.g., deriving a product from a product-line). Since decisions are typically interdependent, it is often neither obvious which decisions have the most significant impact nor which decisions might ultimately conflict. Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art provides little support for dealing with such situations. On the one hand, some conflicts can be avoided by providing more freedom in which order decisions are made (i.e., most important decisions first). On the other hand, conflicts are unavoidable at times, and living with conflicts may be preferable over forcing the user to fix them right away---particularly because fixing conflicts becomes easier as more is known about a user's intentions. This paper introduces the C2O (Configurator 2.0) tool for guided decision-making. The tool allows the user to answer questions in an arbitrary order---with and without the presence of inconsistencies. While giving users those freedoms, it still supports and guides them by (i) rearranging the order of questions according to their potential to minimize user input, (ii) providing guidance to avoid follow-on conflicts, and (iii) supporting users in fixing conflicts at a later time.},
